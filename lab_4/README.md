# Rubik's Cube.
---
## I really liked this lab and so I wrote it in several versions. Here is a brief description of the folders.

### Folders:
+ #### implementation of the rubik's cube without graphics:
    This folder contains the implementation of the Rubik's cube without graphics. There's not much to talk about. I'll just say about the idea. The idea is that inside each cube in the Rubik's cube lies a coordinate axis, which rotates during turns. The cube is assembled when all coordinate axes are rotated the same way.
+ #### implementation of a separate cube with graphics:
    In this folder there is just a separate cube, but already with graphics. You can see how this program works by clicking on the photo.

+ #### implementation of the rubik's cube:
    There should have been a full-fledged Rubik's cube in the same folder, but in order to avoid cheating, I decided not to fill it in entirely, so there are only a couple of main classes here. Also below are the photos. By clicking on any of them, you can see how the full version works.

### If you are an ITMO student and you don't have any ideas, you can try to implement one of the following:
+ you can try to implement a rubik's cube on lists
+ you can imagine a cube in the form of six faces
+ you can imagine a cube in the form of a cross

I think three ideas will be enough to start with. If anything, you can always ask me a question in a [telegram](https://t.me/georgedemyan).
